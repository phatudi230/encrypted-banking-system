BANKING SYSTEM

1.Introduction
This document outlines the development of a banking system program that uses AES encryption to secure data and stores information in an Array List. The project aims to ensure data security and efficient data management.
2.Project Overview
	•	Project Name:  Banking System
	•	Objective: Develop a secure banking system with AES encryption and data storage in an Array List.
	•	Technologies Used: Java, AES Encryption, Array List
	•	GitHub Respiratory: https://github.com/phatudi230/encrypted-banking-system
3.System Design
3.1. AES Encryption
	AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used to encrypt sensitive data such as account details and transaction information. AES is chosen for its efficiency and 			security.
3.2. Data Storage
	Data is stored in an Array List for easy management and retrieval. The Array List will hold objects representing customer accounts and transactions.
